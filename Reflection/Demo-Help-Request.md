I couldn't do this demo as requested because:

a. I don't know where do I find the command line, is this the command line? I suspect it is, if so then do I just paste this:

git commit -m "this is just a test"

I just did, nothing happened?

I hope this was detailed enough for a help request, thank you for taking the time to demo-help.
