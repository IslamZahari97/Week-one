Setting Up Github: Hmmm I did it, but it drained me. I didn't know that setting things up can be hectic but it is.
                   I signed-up for GitHub using my Carleton email but never recieved a validation code even after requesting
                   one multilple times. I waited a couple days to recieve it in case there was a delay in the system after 
                   that I used this occurrence as an excecuse to procrastinate a further two days (bad habit). Then I signed 
                   up for a new account using my Gmail and recieved the validation code right away. This was an inauspicious 
                   start to the course, however I needed to give myself a week to digest the overwhelming newness of everything
                   this course has to offer. It wasn't just the fact that I'm not a techy person that made Week-one overwheling,
                   I also had an epiphany hearing and reading about the Failing Gloriously concept, I realized how much failure 
                   has caused me a lot of anxiety and sadness in the past when it should have been a step to propel me towards
                   success. I was left wondering about the 'what if' of it all: What if I didn't shame myself for failing, what
                   if I wasn't shamed for failing, how much more of a successful student would I have been had the concept of 
                   Failing Gloriously engrained in me earlier? I am not a techy person, I dislike coding, but I am not afraid
                   of trying my best and learning from my failure along the way in this course. Once I came experienced that
                   realization and shook off all the what ifs after journalling and meditation, I moved on to the next step of 
                   this week's (last week's) to-do-list:
Setting Up Hypothesis: Setting up Hypothesis was relatively straight forward, but after doing so I found it difficult to choose 
                       excerpts to highlight or annotate things, but then reminded that I shouldn't put that pressure on myself  
                       because the software was meant to be used as a tool by me rather than me being a tool for the software 
                       (I am proud of myself for thinking that way, I already learned a life-changing lessons from week one 
                        alone; wow!)
Setting up Zotero: Where has this tool been for the past four years of university? I can easily put all of my reading notes in
                   one easily accessible place but only know about it a thousand scattered/lost reading notes later *que in 
                   another epiphany about the importance of sourcing for your own tools rather than relying on instructors (or 
                   parents or bosses) to spoon-feed me all the tips and tricks*. Having said that, this software was the most
                   complicated to set-up this week. It took me while to figure out Zotero Connector because the reading web
                   links that I attempted to save to my library weren't visible there, after a few attempts of un-installing
                   and re-installing I frigured out that because I am using a chrome book, I needed to install an app called
                   Wicked Good Unarchiver from the web store in order for my Zotero chrome extension to be able to run. After 
                   doing that everything was smooth.
Setting Up Discord: This was by far the easiest step of the week. I installed the Discord app, put in the invitation code and
                    I was ready to go.
Asking for Help: This is the step where I committed the biggest mistake of the week. My failure-fearing ego led me to believe 
                 that this is a step for later weeks and that I should be able to complete the basic tasks of week-one without
                 seeking assistance. Yet, it is the basic foundations that I should have asked for help for setting them up 
                 because every week after that relies on the work done in week one. I regret this decision and aim to actively
                 seek help and share my knowledge through Discord more often, more rigorously and most importantly shamelessly.
