Stop getting distracted by Corona, it'll be over when it's over, right now you need to graduate to have a job after Corona.

If faced with an overwhelming task ask yourself why it's overwhelming; most times it is overwhelming because it's not fun
to do, but school isn't supposed to be all fun.

The Discord service is very helpful, show your gratitude for contributors by replying to their tutorials/advices, stating how
they helped you. 

Start sharing your experiences on discord, you are never alone and the service is a tool to enhance course engagement,
something that I currently lack.

Do the readings before the To-do list because it's better to get the hardest part out of the way first.

Digital History can be fun, you just gotta play the game and reflect on your experiences after the game is over, so have fun
with it because this is a valuable oppurtunity for discovery, not only in terms of content but also character; how honest can
I be about failure will help me grow as a student of life beyond this class.
